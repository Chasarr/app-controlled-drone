# App-controlled drone
This is a school project that we decided to make. This contain the android app, server and a client that's on the drone.
In this project you'll need android studio, Python installed.

Note, this project is meant to be use for testing only.
Also, have you checked out my meme page on iFunny yet? Please do that it would mean a lot
